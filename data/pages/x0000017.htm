<html> <HEAD> <TITLE>Vim for Win32</TITLE> </HEAD>  <body>  <H1>Vim for Win32</H1>  Get Vim, a world-class vi clone, for Win32 (Windows NT and Windows 95).  <p> Win32 binaries are available from <a href="#halcyon-vim-win32-ftp">ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/local/gvr/vim/</a>   <H2>Vim 4</H2>  Vim 4.2 was released on Friday 21st June 1996, after several months of beta testing.  It has been tested by quite a few people, it should work without problems on most systems.  <p> Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor vi.  Many new features have been added: multi level undo, command line history, filename completion, block operations, etc.  Those who don't know vi can probably skip this message, unless you are prepared to learn something new and useful.  Vim is especially useful for editing C programs.  <p> Vim should run on any Unix flavor, MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows NT, OS/2 and Amiga.  Ports for VMS, Atari MiNT and Mac are being worked on.  <p> The most interesting changes (there are a whole lot more):  <dl>  <dt>New on-line help system.</dt> 	<dd>Help is now displayed in a window.  Tags can be used 	to jump around in the documentation (like hypertext 	links).</dd>  <dt>Mouse support.</dt> 	<dd>The mouse is supported in an xterm and for MS-DOS. 	It can be used to position the cursor, select the visual 	area, paste a register, etc.</dd>  <dt>Graphical User Interface (GUI).</dt> 	<dd>Included support for GUI: menu's, mouse, scrollbars, 	etc.  Currently only with Motif and Athena 	interface.</dd>  <dt>Command line editing improved.</dt> 	<dd>Separate history for search commands.  Improved 	command line completion (for tags, help, buffer names, 	etc).</dd>  <dt>Improved indenting for C programs.</dt> 	<dd>Added 'cindent' option for configurable C indent 	mode.  Automatic indenting while inserting text.  The 	"=" operator can be used to indent specific lines. 	Formatting of comments (also for other languages and 	e-mail).</dd>  <dt>Searching for words in include files.</dt> 	<dd>Added commands to search for a word in the current 	file and in included files.  List the first match, list 	all matches or jump to a match.  Quickly find out where 	a define, function of variable is declared.</dd>  <dt>Word completion in Insert mode.</dt> 	<dd>Added commands to complete the word before the 	cursor in Insert mode.  Matches can be found in the 	current file, included files and/or a dictionary.  Works 	a lot better than the word completion macros.</dd>  <dt>Automatic commands.</dt> 	<dd>Commands can be automatically executed when reading 	a file, writing a file, jumping to another buffer, etc., 	depending on the file name.  This is useful to set 	options and mappings for C programs, documentation, 	plain text, e-mail, etc.  This also makes it possible to 	edit compressed files.</dd>  <dt>Text objects.</dt> 	<dd>After an operator and in visual mode, text object 	commands can be used to quickly select a word, line or 	paragraph.  Delete the current sentence with "ds". 	Format the current paragraph with "Qp".</dd>  <dt>Options.</dt> 	<dd>A whole bunch of new options.  Command line 	completion can be used to get the old value.  Added '&amp;' 	after option: reset to default value.  Added '!' after 	boolean option: invert value.</dd>  <dt>Support for editing one-line paragraphs.</dt> 	<dd>When a line is longer than the window width, it can 	be broken at a space or other convenient position. 	Commands have been added to move the cursor a screen 	line up/down.</dd>  <dt>Usage of key names.</dt> 	<dd>Special keys now all have a name like &lt;Up&gt;, 	&lt;End&gt;, etc.  This name is used for mappings, in 	listings, and many other things.  Added a number of 	new special keys.</dd>  <dt>Viminfo.</dt> 	<dd>The command line history, marks and registers can be 	stored in a file that is automatically read on startup 	and written on exit.</dd>  <dt>Tag support improved.</dt> 	<dd>Static tags and Emacs tag files are now supported. 	Tag completion works better.</dd>  <dt>Improved (error) messages.</dt> 	<dd>A lot of error messages include the reason for the 	error.  The 'showcommand' includes partially typed 	mappings.</dd>  <dt>Swap file.</dt> 	<dd>Included checking of the actual file name in a swap 	file, avoids giving bogus "swap file exists" messages. 	Give more information about the swap file with the "swap 	file exists" message and when recovering.  Included 	catching of deadly signals for Unix.  Swap files for 	unmodified buffers are deleted, other swap files are 	preserved before exiting.  Improved recovery when there 	are multiple swap files.</dd>  <dt>Compilation improvements.</dt> 	<dd>Autoconf is used to adjust to different Unix 	flavors, editing the Makefile is rarely required.</dd>  <dt>32 bits PC version.</dt> 	<dd>There is now a new version of Vim for Windows NT and 	Windows 95.  It supports long file names, uses all 	available memory and many more enhancements.  There is 	also a protected mode version, compiled with DJGPP, that 	runs under Windows 3.1 and MSDOS.  It supports long file 	names where available.</dd>  <dt>Miscellaneous new features.</dt>         <dd> 	<ul> 	<li>Implemented incremental search.  	<li>A whole bunch of commands that start with "g": Goto 	declaration, show ascii value of character under the 	cursor, go back to end of word, reselect last Visual 	area, etc..  	<li>Added the ":retab" command.  Can be used to change 	the size of a &lt;Tab&gt;, replace spaces with a 	&lt;Tab&gt; or a &lt;Tab&gt; with spaces.  	<li>Implemented "Vim -r" to list any swap files that can be found.  	<li>The "Q" operator no longer affects empty lines.  	<li>Added '-' register for deletes of less than one line.  	<li>Quickfix: Support for several error formats at the same time.  	<li>Added separate mapping for normal mode and visual mode.  	<li>Allow for digraphs to be entered in reverse.  	<li>Added commands to search for #if/#endif and start/end of comment.  	<li>Added ":abclear" and ":mapclear": remove all 	abbreviations/mappings.  	<li>Added check for last modification time of original file before 	overwriting it. 	</ul></dd>  <dt>Vi compatibility improvements.</dt> 	<dd>A few more things have been made vi-compatible.  The 'cpoptions' 	option has a few flags to switch specific vi-compatibility items 	on/off.</dd> </dl>   <h2>VIM Distribution Sites</h2>  Vim can be found at: <ul> <li><a href="ftp://ftp.oce.nl/pub/misc/vim/"> 	ftp://ftp.oce.nl/pub/misc/vim/</a>     		 (slow) </ul>  You can probably also find it (one day later) at: <ul> <li><a href="ftp://petrified.cic.net/mirrors/vim/"> ftp://petrified.cic.net/mirrors/vim/</a>	 (USA)  <li><a href="ftp://jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/unix/vim/"> ftp://jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/unix/vim/</a>	 (USA)  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/utilities/vim/"> ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/utilities/vim/</a> (Germany)  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de/pub/unix/editors/vim/"> ftp://ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de/pub/unix/editors/vim/</a> (Germany)  <li><a href="ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/editors/vim/"> ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/editors/vim/</a> (Germany)  <li><a href="ftp://nuxi.cs.ucdavis.edu/pub/vim"> ftp://nuxi.cs.ucdavis.edu/pub/vim</a>		 (USA)  </ul>  A Linux binary statically linked with Motif can soon be found at: <ul> <li><a href="ftp://ftp.blarg.net/pub/vim"> 	ftp://ftp.blarg.net/pub/vim</a> </ul>  The Win32 binaries are available from this site (Halcyon) <ul> <li><a href="#halcyon-vim-win32-ftp">ftp://ftp.halcyon.com/local/gvr/vim/</a> </ul>    <h2>The Files at the Vim Distribution Sites</h2>  <pre> file                   size   system  contents  unix/vim-4.2.tar.gz    994K   Unix    Sources and docs.  os2/vim42os2.zip       655K   OS/2    OS/2 binary, docs and patch.  pc/vim42r16.zip        593K   MS-DOS  16 bit real mode binary and docs.
