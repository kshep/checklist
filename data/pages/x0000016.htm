This port includes the O'Reiley enhancements. Hip did the first port to NT and is now doing the win32 port. <a href="#perl532">Additional Notes</a><p></td></tr> <tr><td><a href="http://website.ora.com/software/NTPerlb.zip">NT Perl</a> with TCP/IP extensions from <a href="http://website.ora.com/software/">O"reilly and Associates</a></td><td>This one seems to be a little more for NT, with extensions for TCP/IP not usually in Windows ports. It's part of O'Reill's website server, but available for download <a href="#ntperlb">Additional Notes</a><p></td></tr> <tr><td><a href="ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/simtelnet/msdos/perl/perl419x.zip">Len Reed's Port of Perl</a></td><td>This one is a port for MSdos, but runs fine under Win95. If you are doing mostly simple scripts, this is a good choice<p></td></tr>   </table>  <br> <h3><a name="perl532">Perl5 for Win32</a></h3> This has been the most actively maintained version of perl for 32 bit windows. It is  currently the best (IMHO) port there is. It includes all of the socket support that was the main draw back of windows perl versions in the past. They also have a very active group of mailing list to provide support and communications for perl users. <hr> <h3><a name="ntperlb">NT Perl from O'Rielly</a></h3> This port was previously the only one to support sockets and IPC. That is no longer  the case and the PERL5 for WIN32 from HIP, is the recomended version. <hr>  <p>If you disagree with these suggestions, or if you have other ports or better yet, installation tips, please email me at <a href="mailto:moewes@inxpress.net">moewes@inxpress.net</a>. With your help maybe we can finally answer this quesion.</P>  <p>Back to Yahoo <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Languages/Perl/">Perl Resources</a></p>  <hr width=75% align=center> <strong><a href="../index.html">Home</a> | <a href="index.html">Computer</a></strong> | 95-PPP | <a href="internet.html">Internet Help</a> | Perl<br><p> <a href="http://www.webtools.org/counter/">13089</a> hits since April 6, 1996 <small> <hr> URL:http://www.inxpress.net/~moewes/computer/perl95.html<br> &copy 1995 Computer Resource Management.
