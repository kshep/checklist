< <A NAME="story1">WEB TOOLS--TELEPHONY</A>
< <P> VideoPhone For The Internet
< <P><A HREF="http://www.vdolive.com">VDOnet Corp.</A> launched VDOPhone, a version of its VDOLive streaming-video product which supports video telephony on the Internet.
< <P> Like VDOLive itself, the product supports conversations occurring in conjunction with five to six frames of video per second on a 28.8-Kbps modem. But product manager Tony Zuccarino says that even those systems using a 14.4-Kbps connection can attain acceptable videophone frame rates of two to three frames per second.
< <P> This news may comfort owners of faster modems who find their Internet bandwidth degrading due to congestion. "What we're seeing, typically, is that whatever pipe you connect to locally can get a 50 to 75 percent cut in throughput," he acknowledges. "But this means you can still transmit our voice and our video."
< <P> The key to VDO's technology has always been its scalability, Zuccarino adds, and that advantage is increased as congestion increases. "Our video scheme is able to tolerate lots of dropped packets but still deliver a basic image, and it adapts to whatever bandwidth it receives." A second important VDO technology is its network protocols, "which actually measure the bandwidth and tell the code what to do. It's a tight integration between two technologies."
< <P> A lot is happening in terms of standards for Internet audio and video. Zuccarino says that VDO expects standards for the Internet and intranets to diverge over time. On the Internet, there is a market fight going on now between the LiveMedia specification, supported by Netscape and 55 other companies, including VDO, and proposals from Microsoft and Intel, Zuccarino says. "It's Microsoft-Intel on one side, Netscape on the other side," he says. "I expect that to take one to two years before either proposal becomes something you can develop towards, and for that development to coalesce. In the meantime, we have a technology that works well ... we won't keep it off the market until something is established in the market."
< <P> As to the intranets, or corporate Internet, however, Zuccarino says, "This very same package, without one change, instantly adapts upwards to a wide area network (WAN) or local area network (LAN)," topping-out at 15 frames per second on a 150-Kbps line. "You'll get very good quality on a LAN&#173:enough to replace your telephone," he says.
< <P> The key, he says, is that VDO will support whatever standards develop on whatever networks they develop. "We're very modular. We can do audio by itself, video by itself, and use other codes."

> <A NAME="story1">INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS</A>
> <P> Telco Swallows Uunet Technologies
> <P> The buzz in the online industry for the past few days had <A HREF="http://www.uu.net">Uunet</A> Technologies Inc. merging with a communications company that sports a three-letter moniker. <A HREF="http://www.att.com/worldnet">AT&amp;T</A> was the popular guess. But the partner turns out to be MFS, as in MFS Communications Co., Inc., an Omaha, Neb., company that provides business and government customers with local and long-distance voice and data communications services.
> <P> Uunet , the Fairfax-Va.-based Internet services company that built the Microsoft Network, and MFS announced yesterday that they would join forces in a merger that makes the Internet company that specializes in corporate connections a wholly owned division of MFS.
> <P> Wall Street loved the plan, and Uunet's stock was several points higher at the close of business yesterday than at the morning opening. The merger will convert Uunet stock into MFS stock, with the value on the transactions placed at about $2 billion.
> <P> Wall Street's giddiness even spilled over onto other Internet service providers who weren't involved in the deal. For instance, PSINet benefited from the news, as its stock rousted itself from the doldrums where they'd been stuck for the past several weeks.
> <P> "Consolidation" has been the watchword in the Internet access business lately. As more and more telecommunications companies, such as AT&amp;T, MCI, and Bell Atlantic edge into that market, the Uunet-MFS announcement was seen as a sign of mergers to come.
> <P> The synergy between the two companies seems ideal, according to financial and industry analysts. Both concentrate on providing access&#173;Internet and telecommunications&#173;to businesses.
> <P> "We wanted to join up with a telephone company that didn't act like a telephone company," says Alan Taffel, Uunet vice president of marketing. "MFS is entrepreneurial and quick to move, which is necessary in this market."
> <P> The merger will create a company that can offer one-stop shopping for Internet, voice, data, and video services to business customers over an advanced, international, fiber-optic network. According to officials at the two companies, their combined annual revenue will be about $12.24 billion.
> <P> Competitive Access Providers (CAPs) like MFS provide telecommunications services to businesses, often to the dismay of Bell telephone companies that are more heavily regulated. Bell companies have often complained that providers like MFS can skim off their most profitable business customers, leaving them to provide mandated service to less-profitable residential markets, no matter what their location.
> <P> MFS has laid 213,000 miles of fiber-optic cable networks in metropolitan areas around the United States and in Western Europe. Since more than 40 percent of Uunet's network expenses go to buying local communications services, the company now will be able to drive down costs by buying local access wholesale from the MFS telecommunications group.
> <P> Uunet will give MFS the ability to bring Internet access to its customers. Uunet has a reputation for providing reliable Internet services to its own users, as well as to the million-plus MSN customers that use the same network. Microsoft, which owns 13 percent of Uunet, has given the access provider a $25-million interest-free loan to further build out its Internet network last year, which now has 218 points of presence.
> <P> MFS also has 1,200 sales representatives in place to sell the combined services, Taffel says, many more than Uunet.
> <P> "The merger raises the bar for other ISPs in terms of competing on cost-structure now that Uunet is affiliated with a facilities-based communications company," Taffel says.
> <P> The partnership was not unexpected, according to Dan Cunningham, <A HREF="http://www.psi.net">PSINet's</A> vice president for finance. "It gives MFS the ability to bundle an Internet product with telephone service. It will be cutting new ground, because so far, this is an untested market product," he says.
> <P> The move made sense to Tom Evslin, AT&amp;T WorldNet vice president, as well. "The industry is desegregating online content from access, so now it can reaggregate along lines that make more sense. Internet access is more closely aligned with network telephony than with online content," he says.
> <P> This kind of thinking seems to be the wave of the future, as illustrated by <A HREF="http://www.mci.com">MCI</A> , which announced Monday that it will now offer packages of long-distance and cellular services along with Internet access. Microsoft's Bill Gates blessed the merger, too: "We are highly supportive of this merger with MFS, since the combination offers the potential for high bandwidth availability at lower costs for end users."

< <P> Frank Daniels Seeks New Life Online
< <P> Frank Daniels III, the third generation of a Raleigh publishing family and creator of the trendsetting <A HREF="http://www.nando.net">Nando.Net</A> , is leaving journalism to create interactive communities on the Internet.
< <P> Daniels told NetDaily, "I've achieved every goal I set 10 years ago" in journalism, "and it's time to set new goals." He'll be working towards some of those goals at an Internet tool-building company in Greensboro, N.C., called Koz Inc. "They're developing community publishing tools, working with newspaper publishers and community groups to use the net and other technologies to bind their communities together," says Daniels.
< <P> Koz is offering tools to bring a bulletin board system (BBS) model to the Internet, supporting small groups with self-contained packages they can use to create virtual communities quickly. "This would range from Kiwanis Clubs to newspapers and soccer groups. It's database-oriented, based in part on what I've learned here at the News-Observer. "
< <P> Daniels admits that virtual communities, based on common interests, are doing better in the Internet market than geographic communities, but insists, "There is a geographic component to community that is very important to the way most of us live. Almost everyone I know of has an interest community and a geographic community. Those geographic communities won't diminish in importance, and will migrate to the new technologies. Our interest isn't in using communities to make big bucks," he adds, "but to help them help themselves."
< <P> Daniels' family has run the Raleigh newspapers, which have won many Pulitzer Prizes, including a 1996 prize for public service, for decades. The paper was bought by McClatchy Newspapers Inc. of Sacramento in August 1995. McClatchy says it will use the Nando.Net experience as the centerpiece of its efforts to create electronic versions of all its newspapers.
< <P> In addition to working with Koz, Daniels says, he will teach a course on new media at Duke University. "I'm a Duke grad, and Katherine Fulton developed the course. They needed a professor when she left, and it struck my interest to work with students," he says.

> <P> Netscape Begins Public Beta of Version 3.0
> <P><A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</A> officially launched the public beta test of Navigator 3.0, the newest version of its popular Web browser.
> <P> The software, which has been available on the company's Web site for some time, fully integrates video, audio 3-D, and Internet telephony capability with its other features. The new software can be customized for enterprise. Netscape also reports improvements in such 2.0 features as JavaScript, security, and caching. Its built-in multimedia and telephony support should prove controversial with makers of competing products.

< <P> New SoftBank Conglomeration Fosters Web Advertising
< <P> SoftBank Corp. said it has merged the efforts of three units to create SoftBank Interactive Marketing, which will attempt to dominate the business of hawking Web sites as advertising venues.
< <P> The new unit, which won a heavy infusion of new capital from the company's Japanese parent, also adds Network 1.0 to a roster of clients and representation capabilities that includes the company's Ziff-Davis Publishing unit and Andrew Balkin's Interactive Marketing Inc., which were combined just a few weeks ago. Balkin will head the newly-merged companies.
< <P> On the client list, in addition to Ziff, are Fodors, the Los Angeles Times' Hollywood Online, Playboy, NBC Intellicast's Weather Site, the National Football League, Yahoo!, and USWeb, which recently launched a worldwide network of affiliates to provide Web services on a franchised basis. One account, Netscape World, is being dropped as a conflict, says Softbank spokesman Greg Jarboe.
< <P> Ziff-Davis had been an early proponent of I/PRO's I/COUNT technology for auditing Web site traffic, but Jarboe said no decision on an auditing package has been made.

> <P> CyberHound Directory and Search Service Bows
> <P> The hotly competitive Web directory and search engine arena got even more crowded Tuesday as <A HREF="http://www.gale.com/gale.html">Gale Research</A> , a company that has been producing print directories for more than 40 years, introduced <A HREF="http://www.cyberhound.com">CyberHound</A> at the Internet World trade show in San Jose.
> <P> But while the world now has yet another service that seeks and reviews Web sites, people will have to wait a bit longer to find out if they're going to have to pay for CyberHound's pedigreed lineage.
> <P> Gale Research executives announcing the service would say only that the site will be free for users on a trial basis for the next three months. Gale Marketing Manager Margaret Tennant says Gale "has not yet determined specific pricing," but adds CyberHound will accept advertising.
> <P> "We provide a solution to Internet frustration,› says Joanna Zakalik, senior new product development editor. "The frustration is the result of the enormous amount of information that is available on the Internet and with the other search engines that provide thousands of hits," she says. Spiders [software that gathers information for many search engines] provide lots of hits but not good quality. CyberHound relies on human rather than artificial intelligence to sort and index sites,› she says.
> <P> Calling it both a "simple and expert search engine," Koek says CyberHound, can return more accurate hits than software-based search engines because humans determine the site's search delimiters. Reviewed sites can receive one to four stars and are rated based on content, design, technical merit and entertainment value.
> <P> CyberHound's more complex "expert" option offers users a much broader choice of searching criteria than most search engines, with options that include information about how frequently sites are updated, whether they accept advertising, or whether fees are charged for access. In addition to Web sites and Usenet newsgroups, CyberHound can search listservs, gopher, FTP or telnet sites.
> <P> Gale's database, however, includes only information compiled and reviewed by its staff of 10 editors and approximately 100 freelancers in the past four months. While almost 10,000 sites are currently available, CyberHound Project Manager Karen Koek says Gale hopes to have 35,000 site reviews online by the end of the year.
> <P> The Detroit company, which publishes reference works such as the Encyclopedia of Associations, also compiles databases and offers CD-RO M-based products.

> <P> Yahoo Computing was created by culling 35,000 sites from Yahoo's original Computing and Internet categories and combining it with other features, such as site reviews, news updates and original editorial material. Officials from Yahoo and Ziff say they plan eventually to create a "community" on the site by offering speakers, discussion groups and chat options.
> <P> "We built it as an interactive travel guide and travel service to computing sites on the Web," says Ed Passarella, editorial director for Yahoo Computing. To date, he says, the site has accumulated more than 500 reviews, which are rated with up to four stars, and plans to present roundups of specific topic-oriented sites.

< <P> Adobe Offers Demo Versions of Amber
< <P> The next version of Adobe Acrobat, code-named "Amber," is now available from the <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/Amber/">Adobe Web site</A> .
< <P> Adobe says that 300,000 copies of earlier versions of the technology, supporting Adobe's Portable Document Form (PDF), have been downloaded each month since November, and it expects similar rates of downloads for the newest version.
< <P> The new version features new support for corporate intranets, with support for common word processing, spreadsheet, and desktop publishing tools. Among the new features in the latest release are the ability to seamlessly view PDF files directly within leading Web browsers, and technology that allows transparent navigation between PDF files and HTML documents. The demonstration versions of the Acrobat "Amber" Reader support the plug-in architecture of Netscape Navigator 2.0 and ActiveX controls for Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3.0.
< <P> A series of add-ins are also available immediately for <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/Acrobat/Plug-Ins/">Acrobat 2.1</A> , including OLE Server Plug-Ins, allowing PDF files to be read seamlessly from inside Microsoft documents, and a Monitor Setup Plug-in, which supports consistent color representation on many different devices, a capability important to ad agencies and graphic artists.

> <P> Macromedia Releases Backstage
> <P><A HREF="http://www.macromedia.com">Macromedia</A> officially released Backstage, its HTML authoring suite at Internet World in San Jose.
> <P> The company now offers Backstage Designer, the suite's entry-level version, as a free download, although it is also bundled with products like Fujitsu's magneto-optical disk drive. At $79, it's the same price as Netscape Navigator, says Macromedia president Bud Colligan. Scalable upgrades range all the way up to Backstage Enterprise Studio, a version checking in at $2,999. The top-level product allows direct links to client-services databases such as those from Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL, without programming.
> <P> Yesterday at Internet World, product manager Stephen Shannon demonstrated Backstage. It features a Microsoft Word-like interface, and can toggle between views of a page as it will appear on the Web and its source code.
> <P> Perhaps the most intriguing parts of the $99 Backstage Designer Plus are a series of PowerApplets, customizable Macromedia Director and Java applications that add multimedia to Web pages without programming. That product, the first upgrade level from the freely downloaded program, also includes an image editor called Macromedia xRes, and a library of clip art.
> <P> "Our strategy is author once, offer anywhere," says Colligan. The same tools and files being used to build Internet and intranet pages can also be used on CD-ROMs and even in movie production. "Compression, security and streaming should all be integrated" with authoring tools, he says, and all those files should be available on all media.
> <P> "We're going to 'shock' everything," he says, referring to Macromedia's Shockwave plug-ins. He adds that the company will continue its work with Microsoft to "harmonize" its multimedia scripting languages.

AOL also is joining the Windows 95 milieu, in an agreement with <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">Microsoft</A> to rent out a portion of the Win95 desktop.
< <P> Apparently, <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com">CompuServe</A> likes the sound of both these deals.
< <P> "We're real close with AT&amp;T ... a very similar situation to America Online," says a CompuServe spokesperson who requested anonymity. That deal would involve offering CompuServe access, at a reduced rate, to WorldNet customers. The reduced rate is made possible because CompuServe doesn't have to pick up the costs of network access and some customer services, like phone support.
< <P> CompuServe also would like to appear on Microsoft Windows 95 desktops, and expects to wrap that deal up soon. "There's nothing America Online's getting we won't," the CompuServe spokesperson adds.

< <P><A NAME="story3">Chicago Tribune Joins Web</A><BR>
< Shockwave, Java, and RealAudio, coupled with content from broadcast and cable media, will combine to make <A HREF="http://www.chicago.tribune.com">The Chicago Tribune 's</A> recently debuted Web site a truly multimedia news source.
< <P> Owen Youngman, director of interactive media for the Tribune , says the site will offer special coverage to local stories with a national angle, like the upcoming Democratic Convention in August. For that event, the paper plans to put archives of its coverage of the historic 1968 Democratic National Convention online. At that convention, anti-Vietnam War protesters clashed with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's police force on national TV.
< <P> While servers at BBN Planet in Palo Alto, Calif., currently are hosting the site, the paper will evaluate site traffic and make plans to host the site locally. Plans also include the purchase of an ad server and traffic-auditing tools. Youngman says the paper hasn't decided which of several offerings to purchase in these areas.
< <P> Youngman says the new site's content aims a bit higher than the Tribune 's Chicago Online service, carried by America Online. He says the multimedia content will draw content from local television station WGN, and a cable news service. Such components as threaded message boards and e-mail also will be ubiquitous throughout the site, according to Youngman.
< <P> Registration for The Chicago Tribune 's Internet edition will begin around April 15. A small subscription fee for customized services is planned starting in June. Leah Metcalf Gentry, who previously developed the Web site of the Orange County, Calif., Register, is editor of the new service.

< The <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS">Platform for Internet Content Selection</A> has reached the status of an industry standard, according to the father of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee, director of the World Wide Web Consortium.
< <P> In the eight months since PICS was first proposed, according to the consortium, online companies&#173;including America Online, CompuServe, Microsoft, AT&amp;T, and Netscape&#173;have endorsed it, while organizations such as <A HREF="http://www.safesurf.com">SafeSurf</A> and software companies such as <A HREF="http://www.surfwatch.com">SurfWatch</A> and Microsystems Software Inc., makers of CyberPatrol, have built it into their content-control software. The <A HREF="http://www.rsac.org">Recreational Software Advisory Council</A> , which rates video games, developed a PICS-compatible rating system that will be used in Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser, among other places.
< <P> PICS works by embedding labels in the headers of HTML documents. Although the standard doesn't specify the content of labels or how pages are rated, it does outline how they will be coded so they can be read by PICS-compliant software.

< <P> "There's still a lot of educational issues," he says. "We've done limited ads and no direct marketing campaign, other than Internet service provider deals," such as the one with Pipeline. "That will change over the next months as we add additional products. We're working on things for brokerage, insurance, credit cards and other things. When we get to that point, we'll promote the site more online."

< <P><A NAME="story6">Kids' Contest Among Announcements as MS Developers' Conference Wraps Up</A><BR>
< Microsoft wound up its Internet Developers' Conference with a flurry of announcements, including a contest for kids that promises--or maybe threatens--Bill Gates as first prize.
< <P> Kids won't exactly get Microsoft's chairman, who will become a first-time father later this year, to take home, but they do get to visit his office. The content's theme is "Imagine the Magic," and children are challenged to dream up neat stuff that computers could do.
< <P> The kids' site officially launches on Monday. Children ranging from ages 6 to 11 can enter. Other prizes include a PC and software, a cel from the Cartoon Network series Dexter's Laboratory, and appearances on the network and in the magazine. The winners' schools also get computers and software. Turner Broadcasting's <A HREF="http://www.filmzone.com/SpaceGhost">Cartoon Network</A> and Time Inc.'s <A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/SIFK">Sports Illustrated for Kids</A> magazine are co-sponsors.
< <P> The Redmond, Wash., software company also announced its Microsoft Access database program, which will support the Microsoft <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/icp">Internet Control Pack</A> , which is now in beta. The pack, created with NetManage Inc., features six ActiveX Controls that add Internet functionality to other programs. For instance, Access databases will be accessible via standard browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0.
< <P> In addition, Microsoft says more than 40,000 sites that were part of the beta program of its Microsoft <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/">Exchange</A> e-mail server are now in full production using the product.
< <P> Updated information on the conference is available at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/showcase/intpdc/">http://www.microsoft.com/showcase/intpdc/</A> ; after March 18, that address changes to http://www.microsoft.com/intdev for information.

> <A NAME="story1">WEB TOOLS--TELEPHONY</A>
> <P> VideoPhone For The Internet
> <P><A HREF="http://www.vdolive.com">VDOnet Corp.</A> launched VDOPhone, a version of its VDOLive streaming-video product which supports video telephony on the Internet.
> <P> Like VDOLive itself, the product supports conversations occurring in conjunction with five to six frames of video per second on a 28.8-Kbps modem. But product manager Tony Zuccarino says that even those systems using a 14.4-Kbps connection can attain acceptable videophone frame rates of two to three frames per second.
> <P> This news may comfort owners of faster modems who find their Internet bandwidth degrading due to congestion. "What we're seeing, typically, is that whatever pipe you connect to locally can get a 50 to 75 percent cut in throughput," he acknowledges. "But this means you can still transmit our voice and our video."
> <P> The key to VDO's technology has always been its scalability, Zuccarino adds, and that advantage is increased as congestion increases. "Our video scheme is able to tolerate lots of dropped packets but still deliver a basic image, and it adapts to whatever bandwidth it receives." A second important VDO technology is its network protocols, "which actually measure the bandwidth and tell the code what to do. It's a tight integration between two technologies."
> <P> A lot is happening in terms of standards for Internet audio and video. Zuccarino says that VDO expects standards for the Internet and intranets to diverge over time. On the Internet, there is a market fight going on now between the LiveMedia specification, supported by Netscape and 55 other companies, including VDO, and proposals from Microsoft and Intel, Zuccarino says. "It's Microsoft-Intel on one side, Netscape on the other side," he says. "I expect that to take one to two years before either proposal becomes something you can develop towards, and for that development to coalesce. In the meantime, we have a technology that works well ... we won't keep it off the market until something is established in the market."
> <P> As to the intranets, or corporate Internet, however, Zuccarino says, "This very same package, without one change, instantly adapts upwards to a wide area network (WAN) or local area network (LAN)," topping-out at 15 frames per second on a 150-Kbps line. "You'll get very good quality on a LAN&#173:enough to replace your telephone," he says.
> <P> The key, he says, is that VDO will support whatever standards develop on whatever networks they develop. "We're very modular. We can do audio by itself, video by itself, and use other codes."

> <P> Frank Daniels Seeks New Life Online
> <P> Frank Daniels III, the third generation of a Raleigh publishing family and creator of the trendsetting <A HREF="http://www.nando.net">Nando.Net</A> , is leaving journalism to create interactive communities on the Internet.
> <P> Daniels told NetDaily, "I've achieved every goal I set 10 years ago" in journalism, "and it's time to set new goals." He'll be working towards some of those goals at an Internet tool-building company in Greensboro, N.C., called Koz Inc. "They're developing community publishing tools, working with newspaper publishers and community groups to use the net and other technologies to bind their communities together," says Daniels.
> <P> Koz is offering tools to bring a bulletin board system (BBS) model to the Internet, supporting small groups with self-contained packages they can use to create virtual communities quickly. "This would range from Kiwanis Clubs to newspapers and soccer groups. It's database-oriented, based in part on what I've learned here at the News-Observer. "
> <P> Daniels admits that virtual communities, based on common interests, are doing better in the Internet market than geographic communities, but insists, "There is a geographic component to community that is very important to the way most of us live. Almost everyone I know of has an interest community and a geographic community. Those geographic communities won't diminish in importance, and will migrate to the new technologies. Our interest isn't in using communities to make big bucks," he adds, "but to help them help themselves."
> <P> Daniels' family has run the Raleigh newspapers, which have won many Pulitzer Prizes, including a 1996 prize for public service, for decades. The paper was bought by McClatchy Newspapers Inc. of Sacramento in August 1995. McClatchy says it will use the Nando.Net experience as the centerpiece of its efforts to create electronic versions of all its newspapers.
> <P> In addition to working with Koz, Daniels says, he will teach a course on new media at Duke University. "I'm a Duke grad, and Katherine Fulton developed the course. They needed a professor when she left, and it struck my interest to work with students," he says.

> <P> The new unit, which won a heavy infusion of new capital from the company's Japanese parent, also adds Network 1.0 to a roster of clients and representation capabilities that includes the company's Ziff-Davis Publishing unit and Andrew Balkin's Interactive Marketing Inc., which were combined just a few weeks ago. Balkin will head the newly-merged companies.

< <P><A NAME="story1">No Place Like Home? Survey Finds Users Rarely Select New Home Pages</A>
< <P> America Online is a prime starting point for Web exploration, according to the PC Meter Sweeps, the first in a series of cyberspace surveys from the NPD Group ( <A HREF="http://www.npd.com/">http://www.npd.com/</A> ).
< <P> Based on a sample of 1,000 households, NPD listed the 25 most popular sites, with the names of another 30 that also were hit frequently. Interestingly, nearly all the sites listed were either default pages (first displayed when a user logs on to the net via a service provider) or search engines (such as Yahoo and Lycos, which are used to find other Web pages).
< <P> The survey found America Online ( <A HREF="http://www.aol.com/">http://www.aol.com/</A> ) to be, by far, the most popular page, reached by 41 percent of metered households with modems, followed by Netscape ( <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">http://www.netscape.com/</A> ), Yahoo ( <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</A> ), and Infoseek ( <A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com/">http://www.infoseek.com/</A> ).
< <P> Institutions like the University of Michigan, Carnegie-Mellon, and MIT also scored high, perhaps because those users' Internet systems default to the schools' home pages. Private Internet service providers like PrimeNet, AOL's GNN service, and Teleport also scored well; CompuServe and Prodigy also were in the top 25.
< <P> Sex proved to be a big draw: both Penthouse and Playboy made the top 25, and a site called Hot Sex also drew well. Leading sites that didn't make the top 25 but were still high on the list were C/Net ( <A HREF="http://www.cnet.com/">http://www.cnet.com/</A> ), Pathfinder ( <A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/">http://www.pathfinder.com/</A> ), Microsoft ( <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A> ), and IBM ( <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">http://www.ibm.com/</A> ). NASA and the IRS were also popular destinations, as were the Microsoft-NBC Superbowl.com site and USA Today ( <A HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/">http://www.usatoday.com/</A> ).
< <P> NPD used a variety of techniques, including random-sample phone calling, to select the 1,000 households, which were equipped with PC-Meter devices, according to spokesman David Kassnoff. Of those households, 300 had online connections. Most users were male, with the largest portion ages 35 to 54. This sample size, according to NPD, is expected to grow to 10,000 households during the next few months. Meanwhile, subscribers to the PC Meter Sweeps will get monthly data, while the media will get releases each quarter.

< <P><A NAME="story2">Microsoft Keeps on Going...</A>
< <P> Those who have thus far written off Microsoft's Internet efforts as bloated and proprietary should take a look at the latest news coming from the company's developers' conference.
< <P> Microsoft has acquired Colusa Software Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.colusa.com/">http://www.colusa.com/</A> ), and annouced a merger agreement with Aspect Software Engineering Inc. ( <A HREF="http://moose.erie.net/~vito/">http://moose.erie.net/~vito/</A> ). Colusa's Omniware development tool kit lets developers create Internet components using languages like C and C++. Aspect makes dbWeb, a database exporter that provides users of the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with real-time access to databases compatible with the Open Database Connectivity specification.
< <P> As if that isn't enough for one news day, the company also announced two technologies under development. ActiveX Plug-In for Netscape Navigator ( <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">http://www.netscape.com/</A> ), the result of a co-development project with nCompass Labs Inc., lets Netscape users access Web tools developed with ActiveX. The other technology, the Intelligent Console Architecture (ICA) client from Citrix Systems Inc. ( <A HREF="http://web2.airmail.net/nbgdal/citrixx.htm">http://web2.airmail.net/nbgdal/citrixx.htm</A> ), will be included in Internet Explorer 3.0 and future versions of Windows NT. The client will let users run Win32-based applications on remote servers by clicking a link on a Web page.
< <P> A beta version of Microsoft's Internet Control Pack ( <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/icp">http://www.microsoft.com/icp</A> ), including a set of ActiveX Controls, is available on its Web site. The software was developed with NetManage Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.netmanage.com">http://www.netmanage.com</A> ), and will work with all Microsoft development tools, including Visual Basic, Visual C++, Visual FoxPro, and Microsoft Access, as well as third-party tools such as Borland Delphi. It covers several Internet protocols, including Windows Sockets (Winsock), HTML, FTP, news, and mail. With it, developers will be able to build their own custom browsers, integrated file-viewing applications, newsgroup readers, and mail clients, based on Microsoft technology.
< <P> As further support of ActiveX, Microsoft released a new version of its Visual C++ development system, Version 4.1. The subscription-based software also supports delivery of reusable software components through Custom AppWizards, including support of Virtual Reality Modeling Language from Template Graphics Software Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.tgs.com/">http://www.tgs.com/</A> ). Microsoft Foundation Classes for the software will target creation of new applications using the Microsoft Internet Server Application Program Interface (ISAPI) under Windows NT and Windows 95, which Microsoft calls an improvement over using CGI.
< <P> Microsoft says 71 software companies announced immediate support of ActiveX Controls, and more than 40 companies agreed to use the ActiveMovie tool kit immediately to create new "instant play" content on the Web.

< <P><A NAME="story4">Online Providers to Empower Consumers</A><BR>
< By Kate Gerwig
< <P> The public eye has become so focused on the potential dangers of the online world that a consortium of major Internet industry players has joined together to launch the first public education campaign on consumer safety in cyberspace.
< <P> While government legislative and regulatory bodies historically have left the computer and online industries alone, government concern over user safety and privacy has grown along with the record numbers of users trying out online services and the Internet, according to Project Open. "The industry has to work together or we will see the potential of this industry disappear because people who don't understand it will kill it," says Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft vice president of applications and content.
< <P> In a pre-emptive attempt to regulate itself rather than have the government step in, online industry companies that include AT&amp;T, America Online, Prodigy, CompuServe, Microsoft, Netcom, the Interactive Services Association, and the National Consumers League, last year organized to propose industry-driven solutions to potential online problems. Their hope was that by regulating themselves, they would prevent government legislators and regulators from rushing in to control a medium they often don't fully understand.
< <P> "The promise of an interactive revolution brings mainstream responsibiilties with it, and the industry has to work together to established a unified front to protect consumers," says Steve Case, AOL chairman. "The consumer focus sometimes gets lost in the discussion of alliances and technology, but it has to be at the center in order to move to a more mainstream audience."
< <P> Project Open is focused on four major issues facing the growing online market: tools that will help individual users control the flow of potentially offensive information; online copyright law; consumer protection; and user privacy.
< <P> The group introduced the first part of its awareness program Tuesday, and will follow with the copyright, consumer protection, and user privacy portions later this year. Consumer information on how to get the most out of going online is available on the group's Web site at <A HREF="http://www.isa.net/project-open">http://www.isa.net/project-open</A> , in a brochure called "Making the Net Work for You," and through a toll-free number, 800-466-OPEN.
< <P> Building on the information-highway theme, the group unveiled a slogan that urges parents to "give your kids some driver's ed" to help them learn the rules of the information superhighway. One of the realities of the maturing online industry is that companies increasingly need to lobby to protect and explain online issues to the public and to government officials.
< <P> Project Open companies are working with members of a House Judiciary subcommittee that is drafting online copyright legislation, according to Paulette White, CompuServe vice president of information services. Project Open also is working with the Federal Trade Commission to establish guidelines to buy, sell, and advertise goods online, and will help educate consumers so they can recognize and report fraudulent online activity. In the future, people will be able to contact Project Open "as a kind of online Better Business Bureau" to register complaints about fraudulent cybercommerce as well as to check out online businesses track records, says Ed Bennett, Prodigy president and CEO.
< <P> Project Open is backed by several educational associations, including the National Education Association.

On Monday, it gave its blessing for its proprietary online service to join with Netscape Navigator in providing AOL members net access. Yesterday, it decided that Microsoft's Internet Explorer also looks good on AOL's arm. Continuing this trend of increasingly strange bedfellows, Microsoft will include America Online software with future versions of Windows 95.
< <P> Steve Case, AOL's chief executive officer, announced in a CNBC interview Tuesday that Netscape Navigator will be the preferred browser on GNN, while Microsoft Internet Explorer will become the browser of choice for America Online members surfing the net. However, both browsers will be available to subscribers of either service, according to an AOL spokeswoman.
< <P> It will take time for all this to happen. Case told CNBC the next revision of AOL software will retain the current browser. Incorporation of AOL software into Windows 95 will begin this summer, with the onliner offered as a folder on the Windows 95 desktop, much like Microsoft's own MSN service. AOL said it will also support Microsoft's ActiveX technologies (see below) in its future service.

< <P><A NAME="story2">CompuServe Debuts WOW</A>
< <P> By Judith H. Bernstein | After months of hush-hush planning, CompuServe today took the wraps off WOW, its new online service targeted at families and newcomers to cyberspace.
< <P> WOW will cost $17.95 per month for unlimited access, according to spokesman Matt Wolfrom. Scott Kauffman, WOW's vice president and general manager, says each account supports up to six separate users, and can be customized to provide different levels of access for adults and children, and eventually for teenagers. For instance, the WOW interface for children does not allow youngsters to choose options such as chat or shopping; in addition, all e-mail sent to a child's account first passes through a parent's mailbox so mom or dad can check on it. Kauffman points out that WOW's graphical interface does not feature the pulldown menus or windows common to other online services, but rather large buttons that the user clicks on to access main subject sections such as Entertainment, Living, Sports, and Money, and choices within each subject that include chat, reference, news, shopping, and the Internet.
< <P> And, unlike the ubiquitous floppy disks given out by the service's main rival in the family-oriented market, America Online, WOW only will be distributed on CD-ROM and will only work on machines equipped with Windows 95 and a minimum of 8 MB of RAM, although the company recommends 16 MB. WOW uses Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its Web browser; it also provides users with Internet access to FTP, gopher, Telnet, and Usenet.
< <P> WOW is about service, branding and marketing, not about hardware and software, Kauffman says. Earlier this month, WOW had announced that it would sell the service through Tandy Corp.'s Incredible Universe and Computer City stores, and one spokeswoman suggested that consumers may find the WOW CD-ROM bundled in their boxes of breakfast cereal rather than bagged with magazines as AOL disks generally are. Kauffman also promises customer service to be provided by an outside firm that will be available 365 days a year, 24 hours a day to hold new users' hands as they venture online. He also promises a person will answer that call for help, not a recording asking subscribers to hang on, waiting for a service rep.
< <P> Adam Schoenfeld, vice president of Jupiter Communications, thinks WOW has a good chance to succeed, despite the head-start services like AOL and Prodigy have with families. "The greatest growth area right now is for families and kids. Online services and the Internet are a great thing for the family. Kids can e-mail grandparents more easily than writing a letter and everyone will be very happy," says Schoenfeld.

( <A HREF="http://moose.erie.net/~vito/">http://moose.erie.net/~vito/</A> ). Colusa's Omniware development tool kit lets developers create Internet components using languages like C and C++. Aspect makes dbWeb, a database exporter that provides users of the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with real-time access to databases compatible with the Open Database Connectivity specification.
> <P> As if that isn't enough for one news day, the company also announced two technologies under development. ActiveX Plug-In for Netscape Navigator ( <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">http://www.netscape.com/</A> ), the result of a co-development project with nCompass Labs Inc., lets Netscape users access Web tools developed with ActiveX.

( <A HREF="http://web2.airmail.net/nbgdal/citrixx.htm">http://web2.airmail.net/nbgdal/citrixx.htm</A> ), will be included in Internet Explorer 3.0 and future versions of Windows NT. The client will let users run Win32-based applications on remote servers by clicking a link on a Web page.
> <P> A beta version of Microsoft's Internet Control Pack ( <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/icp">http://www.microsoft.com/icp</A> ), including a set of ActiveX Controls, is available on its Web site. The software was developed with NetManage Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.netmanage.com">http://www.netmanage.com</A> ), and will work with all Microsoft development tools, including Visual Basic, Visual C++, Visual FoxPro, and Microsoft Access, as well as third-party tools such as Borland Delphi. It covers several Internet protocols, including Windows Sockets (Winsock), HTML, FTP, news, and mail. With it, developers will be able to build their own custom browsers, integrated file-viewing applications, newsgroup readers, and mail clients, based on Microsoft technology.
> <P> As further support of ActiveX, Microsoft released a new version of its Visual C++ development system, Version 4.1. The subscription-based software also supports delivery of reusable software components through Custom AppWizards, including support of Virtual Reality Modeling Language from Template Graphics Software Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.tgs.com/">http://www.tgs.com/</A> ). Microsoft Foundation Classes for the software will target creation of new applications using the Microsoft Internet Server Application Program Interface (ISAPI) under Windows NT and Windows 95, which Microsoft calls an improvement over using CGI.
> <P> Microsoft says 71 software companies announced immediate support of ActiveX Controls, and more than 40 companies agreed to use the ActiveMovie tool kit immediately to create new "instant play" content on the Web.

< <P><A NAME="story3">Will Microsoft ActiveX Cool Java's Heat?</A><BR>
< Microsoft announced ActiveX Technologies ( <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/intdev">http://www.microsoft.com/intdev</A> ), which link video, 3-D and other active technologies to the Web through Microsoft's Windows NT and Internet Information Server. Sun's Java tools are a potential target for Active X, since "active controls can be used to build applets," says Pam Kahl, a Microsoft spokeswoman.
< <P> Common Ground Software ( <A HREF="http://www.commonground.com">http://www.commonground.com</A> ), whose Digital Paper document-viewing software competes with Adobe Acrobat, is supporting ActiveX&#173;even before new toolkits became available, says Nick Gault, Common Ground's vice president, engineering. "If you're using Microsoft Internet Explorer and have a link to a page with our content on it, but you don't have the player on your machine ... the ActiveX architecture will go out over the Internet and find this controller, with security, download it, and deploy it automatically ... this happens in a way that's completely transparent to the user. Within 30 seconds, you're looking at a Digital Paper document, in place, in Explorer." Since Digital Paper is based on a single, 250-KB player, compared to the 3-MB Acrobat player, which requires an installation process, Gault feels his firm will benefit.
< <P> While Common Ground was able to put together a Netscape plug-in within a few days, "ActiveX is much more complex, and much more powerful," says Gault. The only problem, Gault adds, is that ActiveX will require Windows NT on the server-side, while Java will serve from any machine. As NT goes, in other words, so goes ActiveX.

< <P><A NAME="story4">Microsoft Pushing ISDN with Bells</A><BR>
< Microsoft ( <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn</A> ) this week began a campaign to promote digital phone service under Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) standards, in conjunction with the regional Bell companies, GTE, and others. Among these providers is Ameritech Corp. ( <A HREF="http://www.ameritech.com">http://www.ameritech.com</A> ).
< <P> Ameritech has long been among the most aggressive of the regional Bells in pushing ISDN, which delivers two 64-Kbps data channels and a 16-Kbps signaling channel in place of an analog phone line. With Ameritech, this service costs just 30 percent more than an analog phone line&#173;a far more aggressive price than that offered by other regional Bells, and the company has been test-marketing a shrink-wrapped ISDN solution, using a Motorola "ISDN modem," in Illinois for over a year.
< <P> Stephen Rys, director of new business development for Ameritech Consumer Services, tells NetDaily that Microsoft's data center will be "another avenue for ISDN orders, as opposed to you [consumers] calling us." Consumers who buy ISDN solutions under Windows 95 will have their ordering information automatically forwarded to the phone company, which will then call and verify it. In addition to getting the order without much work, Ameritech also gets its logo on each user's Windows 95 desktop, Rys says.
< <P> Available now on the Microsoft Web site, the software is expected to debut on store shelves in August.
< <P> "ISDN has a lot of benefits for customers," he concludes. "It also has a lot of complexity. Customers just want to buy it and have it work," says Rys.

> <P><A NAME="story4">Online Providers to Empower Consumers</A><BR>
> By Kate Gerwig
> <P> The public eye has become so focused on the potential dangers of the online world that a consortium of major Internet industry players has joined together to launch the first public education campaign on consumer safety in cyberspace.
> <P> While government legislative and regulatory bodies historically have left the computer and online industries alone, government concern over user safety and privacy has grown along with the record numbers of users trying out online services and the Internet, according to Project Open. "The industry has to work together or we will see the potential of this industry disappear because people who don't understand it will kill it," says Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft vice president of applications and content.
> <P> In a pre-emptive attempt to regulate itself rather than have the government step in, online industry companies that include AT&amp;T, America Online, Prodigy, CompuServe, Microsoft, Netcom, the Interactive Services Association, and the National Consumers League, last year organized to propose industry-driven solutions to potential online problems. Their hope was that by regulating themselves, they would prevent government legislators and regulators from rushing in to control a medium they often don't fully understand.
> <P> "The promise of an interactive revolution brings mainstream responsibiilties with it, and the industry has to work together to established a unified front to protect consumers," says Steve Case, AOL chairman. "The consumer focus sometimes gets lost in the discussion of alliances and technology, but it has to be at the center in order to move to a more mainstream audience."
> <P> Project Open is focused on four major issues facing the growing online market: tools that will help individual users control the flow of potentially offensive information; online copyright law; consumer protection; and user privacy.
> <P> The group introduced the first part of its awareness program Tuesday, and will follow with the copyright, consumer protection, and user privacy portions later this year. Consumer information on how to get the most out of going online is available on the group's Web site at <A HREF="http://www.isa.net/project-open">http://www.isa.net/project-open</A> , in a brochure called "Making the Net Work for You," and through a toll-free number, 800-466-OPEN.
> <P> Building on the information-highway theme, the group unveiled a slogan that urges parents to "give your kids some driver's ed" to help them learn the rules of the information superhighway. One of the realities of the maturing online industry is that companies increasingly need to lobby to protect and explain online issues to the public and to government officials.
> <P> Project Open companies are working with members of a House Judiciary subcommittee that is drafting online copyright legislation, according to Paulette White, CompuServe vice president of information services. Project Open also is working with the Federal Trade Commission to establish guidelines to buy, sell, and advertise goods online, and will help educate consumers so they can recognize and report fraudulent online activity. In the future, people will be able to contact Project Open "as a kind of online Better Business Bureau" to register complaints about fraudulent cybercommerce as well as to check out online businesses track records, says Ed Bennett, Prodigy president and CEO.
> <P> Project Open is backed by several educational associations, including the National Education Association.

< <P><A NAME="story5">DirecTV to Offer Satellite-Based Online Access</A>
< <P> GM-Hughes' DirecTV ( <A HREF="http://www.directv.com">http://www.directv.com</A> ) direct broadcast satellite service will work with Microsoft to deliver online access through its dishes.
< <P> The Microsoft agreement comes within months of AT&amp;T's decision to buy part of DirecTV, and within weeks of MCI and News Corp.'s announcement that they would launch a Direct TV competitor providing data services from start-up. The latter operation is expected to be up and running in the late 1997 to early 1998 timeframe.
< <P> A DirecTV spokeswoman emphasized that the new service will be delivered to PCs, not TVs. Microsoft will develop specifications for a version of its DSS decoder, which can be integrated in new Windows 95 PCs, and can be used to upgrade older computers. Microsoft became a DSS licensee through separate agreement with DirecTV and Thomson Consumer Electronics, a French company which does business in the U.S. under the RCA brand, and holds key digital compression technology. Microsoft will work with PC makers licensed separately by DirecTV and Thomson to meet the specifications of its decoders.
< <P> The Direct TV/Microsoft system is expected for an end-of-year release, according to a Microsoft spokeswoman. However, the number of technology components involved, as well as the high number of firms involved in the project, may make "early next year" a more realistic launch date.

< <P><A NAME="story6">More from the Microsoft Development Conference ...</A>
< <P> Microsoft made a number of moves at its Developer Conference in San Francisco, in addition to its ActiveX, ISDN, and AOL bundling deals.
< <P> One of the most interesting new offerings is the announcement of the ActiveMovie Streaming Format (ASF), whose files will carry the extension .asf. Early reports on this indicated it would compete with VDOLive from VDONet ( <A HREF="http://www.vdolive.com">http://www.vdolive.com</A> ), but the company's official release on the ActiveMovie add-on toolkit included favorable comment from VDONet president Asaf Mohr, and featured more than 40 supporting firms, including VDONet.
< <P> According to Microsoft, ASF can be used for archiving, annotating, indexing, and transmitting all forms of synchronized multimedia content in a single datastream. A host of media types can be easily encapsulated into it, Microsoft said, including Apple's QuickTime and the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) formats, among others. And the results can be sent over many types of networks, not just the Internet. The toolkit includes an ASF Editor, which is a graphical authoring kit, a Software Development Kit (SDK), and an ActiveMovie Filter which works with other Internet browsers, allowing local playback of .asf files.
< <P> Microsoft also announced a number of what it calls "peer Web services" technologies, making it easier to publish home pages and create personal Web sites. The announcement basically makes HTML another core networking technology supported by Microsoft, alongside Windows NT and NetWare, said Microsoft product manager Steve Guggenheimer.
< <P> In part to demonstrate these advances, Microsoft introduced the WebPost Wizard, which walks authors through the process of publishing to a Web server using a simple graphical interface. The Wizard will be available under both Windows 95 and Windows NT. The Wizard is not yet on the Microsoft Web site, but the company said it will be published there soon.
< <P> Microsoft unveiled the next major release of its Internet Explorer, Version 3.0. It's the first Internet client to integrate ActiveX, and also supports Netscape Frames, Sun's Java, and stylesheets. Netcom ( <A HREF="http://www.netcom.com">http://www.netcom.com</A> ) said it will license the new Internet Explorer as its preferred browser.

< <P><A NAME="story1">Live, from AT&amp;T WorldNet, it's ... AOL?</A>
< <P> When it became obvious that the Web was the way to go, America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy incorporated Web access into their services. But why not do it the other way around as well? AT&amp;T's WorldNet Internet service ( <A HREF="http://www.att.com/worldnet">http://www.att.com/worldnet</A> ), officially launching March 14, is doing just that, by offering its subscribers direct access to America Online ( <A HREF="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</A> ).
< <P> AOL sees this new access path to its online services as a way of lending structure to a sometimes exceedingly broad medium. "There's almost too much content on the Web today, so for those consumers who we think will want a bit more order, a bit more packaging ... America Online will remain a top choice," says Ted Leonsis, president of AOL Services Co.
< <P> The non-exclusive agreement will give WorldNet customers a discount on their AOL rates, since AT&amp;T will be providing the link to AOL's Vienna, Virginia, computers, said Tom Evslin, vice president, Worldnet. "The America Online price will reflect the fact that customers are getting their access through AT&amp;T. This will be an excellent way, both economically and technically, to get to America Online. Customers will be billed separately for their access to America Online and WorldNet." AT&amp;T Worldnet will also distribute the software needed for America Online, and will promote the commercial onliner, Evslin said.
< <P> Separately, AT&amp;T said it's gotten over 147,000 requests for WorldNet services and software since announcing the offering February 27, with over 210,000 separate inquiries. The service will offer five hours of free access each month for a year, and a $19.95 flat rate for unlimited service each month. Evslin says over half the calls were from people interested in the flat-rate plan, and that while additional customer service representatives are being assigned to handle the volume, it may take a few weeks for some people to get their software.

> <P> America Online ( <A HREF="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</A> ) just can't pull itself away from the altar. On Monday, it gave its blessing for its proprietary online service to join with Netscape Navigator in providing AOL members net access. Yesterday, it decided that Microsoft's Internet Explorer also looks good on AOL's arm. Continuing this trend of increasingly strange bedfellows, Microsoft will include America Online software with future versions of Windows 95.
> <P> Steve Case, AOL's chief executive officer, announced in a CNBC interview Tuesday that Netscape Navigator will be the preferred browser on GNN, while Microsoft Internet Explorer will become the browser of choice for America Online members surfing the net. However, both browsers will be available to subscribers of either service, according to an AOL spokeswoman.
> <P> It will take time for all this to happen. Case told CNBC the next revision of AOL software will retain the current browser. Incorporation of AOL software into Windows 95 will begin this summer, with the onliner offered as a folder on the Windows 95 desktop, much like Microsoft's own MSN service. AOL said it will also support Microsoft's ActiveX technologies (see below) in its future service.

< <P><A NAME="story2">Netscape Signs Alliance With America Online</A>
< <P> As AOL readies for its WorldNet debut, it's also putting a more familiar face&#173;Netscape Navigator&#173;on the "Internet Connection," its barely one-year-old gateway to the net.
< <P> AOL has entered a marketing and technology alliance with Netscape ( <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">http://www.netscape.com</A> ). It was the second such deal for Netscape in as many business days, following a similar agreement with CompuServe ( <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com">http://www.compuserve.com</A> ). America Online said it will license the Netscape Navigator browser for use both on its commercial online service and its GNN ( <A HREF="http://gnn.com">http://gnn.com</A> ) Internet-only service. America Online has over 5 million customers, and CompuServe 4 million more.
< <P> The deal is further confirmation of Netscape's evolution as the primary interface for the World Wide Web. CompuServe had bought Spry Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.spry.com">http://www.spry.com</A> ) of Seattle, which made the Internet in a Box package, including a Spyglass-licensed ( <A HREF="http://www.spyglass.com">http://www.spyglass.com</A> ) browser called Spry Mosaic. Around the same time, America Online bought a browser-maker, and eventually offered its members a proprietary browser as part of its basic "Internet Connection." Now, apparently, both those investments are being scrapped in favor of Netscape.
< <P> Still, it would be a mistake to write off Microsoft in the Web market, said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Inc., a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. "Anybody who thinks Bill Gates was asleep at the switch on this is absolutely wrong," he said. "Ultimately what Microsoft is going to say is, 'Hey, as far as we're concerned, the Internet interface is just part of the operating system.'"

> <P><A NAME="story2">CompuServe Debuts WOW</A>
> <P> By Judith H. Bernstein | After months of hush-hush planning, CompuServe today took the wraps off WOW, its new online service targeted at families and newcomers to cyberspace.
> <P> WOW will cost $17.95 per month for unlimited access, according to spokesman Matt Wolfrom. Scott Kauffman, WOW's vice president and general manager, says each account supports up to six separate users, and can be customized to provide different levels of access for adults and children, and eventually for teenagers. For instance, the WOW interface for children does not allow youngsters to choose options such as chat or shopping; in addition, all e-mail sent to a child's account first passes through a parent's mailbox so mom or dad can check on it. Kauffman points out that WOW's graphical interface does not feature the pulldown menus or windows common to other online services, but rather large buttons that the user clicks on to access main subject sections such as Entertainment, Living, Sports, and Money, and choices within each subject that include chat, reference, news, shopping, and the Internet.
> <P> And, unlike the ubiquitous floppy disks given out by the service's main rival in the family-oriented market, America Online, WOW only will be distributed on CD-ROM and will only work on machines equipped with Windows 95 and a minimum of 8 MB of RAM, although the company recommends 16 MB. WOW uses Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its Web browser; it also provides users with Internet access to FTP, gopher, Telnet, and Usenet.
> <P> WOW is about service, branding and marketing, not about hardware and software, Kauffman says. Earlier this month, WOW had announced that it would sell the service through Tandy Corp.'s Incredible Universe and Computer City stores, and one spokeswoman suggested that consumers may find the WOW CD-ROM bundled in their boxes of breakfast cereal rather than bagged with magazines as AOL disks generally are. Kauffman also promises customer service to be provided by an outside firm that will be available 365 days a year, 24 hours a day to hold new users' hands as they venture online. He also promises a person will answer that call for help, not a recording asking subscribers to hang on, waiting for a service rep.
> <P> Adam Schoenfeld, vice president of Jupiter Communications, thinks WOW has a good chance to succeed, despite the head-start services like AOL and Prodigy have with families. "The greatest growth area right now is for families and kids. Online services and the Internet are a great thing for the family. Kids can e-mail grandparents more easily than writing a letter and everyone will be very happy," says Schoenfeld.

< Graphic Imaging Inc. launched a new 3-D world called Old Town Crossroads ( <A HREF="http://www.gic.net/xroad.html">http://www.gic.net/xroad.html</A> ).
< <P> GIC president David Goldstein said that the business model for the new site is somewhat unformed, although he hopes to add some small ads to the site as traffic builds. "We don't want to charge users," he said. Graphic artist Tom Epps is Goldstein's partner in the venture.
< <P> The site is based on Macintosh software such as Infinity 3-D and basic HTML coding, not the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) used by companies like Worlds Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.worlds.net">http://www.worlds.net</A> ). "VRML is something we'll get into in a few months.

We may have VRML for advanced users, but we want to have a good starting point for beginners."
< <P> Goldstein said he's designed his site as a consumer's first stop on the Web, with links to movie and TV sites, newspaper sites, and political sites, all easy to reach. Users can also register as citizens of Old Town, which might enable them to feel more connected or "at home" in cyberspace.

> <P><A NAME="story3">Will Microsoft ActiveX Cool Java's Heat?</A><BR>
> Microsoft announced ActiveX Technologies ( <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/intdev">http://www.microsoft.com/intdev</A> ), which link video, 3-D and other active technologies to the Web through Microsoft's Windows NT and Internet Information Server. Sun's Java tools are a potential target for Active X, since "active controls can be used to build applets," says Pam Kahl, a Microsoft spokeswoman.
> <P> Common Ground Software ( <A HREF="http://www.commonground.com">http://www.commonground.com</A> ), whose Digital Paper document-viewing software competes with Adobe Acrobat, is supporting ActiveX&#173;even before new toolkits became available, says Nick Gault, Common Ground's vice president, engineering. "If you're using Microsoft Internet Explorer and have a link to a page with our content on it, but you don't have the player on your machine ... the ActiveX architecture will go out over the Internet and find this controller, with security, download it, and deploy it automatically ... this happens in a way that's completely transparent to the user. Within 30 seconds, you're looking at a Digital Paper document, in place, in Explorer." Since Digital Paper is based on a single, 250-KB player, compared to the 3-MB Acrobat player, which requires an installation process, Gault feels his firm will benefit.
> <P> While Common Ground was able to put together a Netscape plug-in within a few days, "ActiveX is much more complex, and much more powerful," says Gault. The only problem, Gault adds, is that ActiveX will require Windows NT on the server-side, while Java will serve from any machine. As NT goes, in other words, so goes ActiveX.

< <P> DialWeb will allow customers to update their Web pages directly from touchtone phones, says Chuck Rigby, vice president-sales of the Baltimore-based company. "They call our service," enter a security code like that used for withdrawing money from an ATM machine, "and then they select options off the keypad to update specific links, say, with an audio message."
< <P> A-mail will be a more robust package, allowing Web-site managers to send as many as 10,000 voice mail messages at once to an e-mail list. "You could call our system, select a numbered list, leave the message, and the audio goes out as an e-mail attachment," Rigby explains. Recipients can use whatever audio decoding program they prefer, although Connect Inc. is mainly using RealAudio ( <A HREF="http://www.realaudio.com">http://www.realaudio.com</A> ), "because it's most heavily used," Rigby says.

Among these providers is Ameritech Corp. ( <A HREF="http://www.ameritech.com">http://www.ameritech.com</A> ).
> <P> Ameritech has long been among the most aggressive of the regional Bells in pushing ISDN, which delivers two 64-Kbps data channels and a 16-Kbps signaling channel in place of an analog phone line. With Ameritech, this service costs just 30 percent more than an analog phone line&#173;a far more aggressive price than that offered by other regional Bells, and the company has been test-marketing a shrink-wrapped ISDN solution, using a Motorola "ISDN modem," in Illinois for over a year.
> <P> Stephen Rys, director of new business development for Ameritech Consumer Services, tells NetDaily that Microsoft's data center will be "another avenue for ISDN orders, as opposed to you [consumers] calling us." Consumers who buy ISDN solutions under Windows 95 will have their ordering information automatically forwarded to the phone company, which will then call and verify it. In addition to getting the order without much work, Ameritech also gets its logo on each user's Windows 95 desktop, Rys says.

> <P> GM-Hughes' DirecTV ( <A HREF="http://www.directv.com">http://www.directv.com</A> ) direct broadcast satellite service will work with Microsoft to deliver online access through its dishes.
> <P> The Microsoft agreement comes within months of AT&amp;T's decision to buy part of DirecTV, and within weeks of MCI and News Corp.'s announcement that they would launch a Direct TV competitor providing data services from start-up. The latter operation is expected to be up and running in the late 1997 to early 1998 timeframe.
> <P> A DirecTV spokeswoman emphasized that the new service will be delivered to PCs, not TVs. Microsoft will develop specifications for a version of its DSS decoder, which can be integrated in new Windows 95 PCs, and can be used to upgrade older computers. Microsoft became a DSS licensee through separate agreement with DirecTV and Thomson Consumer Electronics, a French company which does business in the U.S. under the RCA brand, and holds key digital compression technology. Microsoft will work with PC makers licensed separately by DirecTV and Thomson to meet the specifications of its decoders.
> <P> The Direct TV/Microsoft system is expected for an end-of-year release, according to a Microsoft spokeswoman. However, the number of technology components involved, as well as the high number of firms involved in the project, may make "early next year" a more realistic launch date.

> <P> One of the most interesting new offerings is the announcement of the ActiveMovie Streaming Format (ASF), whose files will carry the extension .asf. Early reports on this indicated it would compete with VDOLive from VDONet ( <A HREF="http://www.vdolive.com">http://www.vdolive.com</A> ), but the company's official release on the ActiveMovie add-on toolkit included favorable comment from VDONet president Asaf Mohr, and featured more than 40 supporting firms, including VDONet.

And the results can be sent over many types of networks, not just the Internet. The toolkit includes an ASF Editor, which is a graphical authoring kit, a Software Development Kit (SDK), and an ActiveMovie Filter which works with other Internet browsers, allowing local playback of .asf files.

< <P><A NAME="story1">AOL Demos Updated Software</A>
< <P> America Online is tooling up for a Web-friendly future, but its feet are still planted firmly in its proprietary world. On Wednesday, the Vienna, Va.-based commercial online service demonstrated updated versions of its Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Macintosh software at a day-long meeting with industry analysts and press representatives at its headquarters.
< <P> The new software is based on open Internet protocols and uses standard HTML protocols, in addition to supporting most Netscape extensions, says AOL vice president of product marketing David Gang. It will more tightly mix AOL content with Web content, he says. For example, you will be able to create URL links in e-mail. The e-mail feature will work when sending mail to other AOL users, as well as Microsoft Network and Netscape mail users.
< <P> However, AOL chairman and president Steve Case says he believes faster access speeds via ISDN and cable modems&#173;the stuff that ideal Web connections are made of&#173;are about three years away, which means AOL still will concentrate on making its service usable for customers at modem speeds of 9600 and 14.4-Kbps. "There is a reality gap between the mass consumer audience and the Web," Case says. "The truth is that using a 14.4 modem to access the Web is frustratingly slow. There just isn't enough evidence that the Web is ready for prime time."
< <P> In answer to press reports that the company is in talks with AT&amp;T about providing some AOL content on AT&amp;T's new WorldNet residential dial-up Internet access service, Case would confirm only that his company is "talking to everybody." AOL also is talking to Apple about acquiring its 147,000 eWorld online service customers when Apple closes the service at the end of March. AOL would not discuss details of any pending deals, other than to say talks were in progress with several companies.
< <P> AOL also says it will be improving its publishing tools for content partners, simplifying the software that allows them to drag and drop text and graphics into their home pages. AOL appears to be holding firm behind its belief that most consumers venturing online need guidance and help with where to go. Companies like AOL, Case says, are more helpful to consumers than companies that provide pure Internet access, making users fend for themselves on the net.
< <P> AOL will preview its Windows 3.1 upgrade April 15 and ship disks in July, according to AOL vice president of product marketing David Gang. The Windows 95 and Macintosh 3.0 upgrades will be available in August, though Mac users can use an interim upgrade, version 2.7, in May until the 3.0 version is ready for release in August.

> <P><A NAME="story1">Live, from AT&amp;T WorldNet, it's ... AOL?</A>
> <P> When it became obvious that the Web was the way to go, America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy incorporated Web access into their services. But why not do it the other way around as well? AT&amp;T's WorldNet Internet service ( <A HREF="http://www.att.com/worldnet">http://www.att.com/worldnet</A> ), officially launching March 14, is doing just that, by offering its subscribers direct access to America Online ( <A HREF="http://www.aol.com">http://www.aol.com</A> ).
> <P> AOL sees this new access path to its online services as a way of lending structure to a sometimes exceedingly broad medium. "There's almost too much content on the Web today, so for those consumers who we think will want a bit more order, a bit more packaging ... America Online will remain a top choice," says Ted Leonsis, president of AOL Services Co.
> <P> The non-exclusive agreement will give WorldNet customers a discount on their AOL rates, since AT&amp;T will be providing the link to AOL's Vienna, Virginia, computers, said Tom Evslin, vice president, Worldnet. "The America Online price will reflect the fact that customers are getting their access through AT&amp;T. This will be an excellent way, both economically and technically, to get to America Online. Customers will be billed separately for their access to America Online and WorldNet." AT&amp;T Worldnet will also distribute the software needed for America Online, and will promote the commercial onliner, Evslin said.
> <P> Separately, AT&amp;T said it's gotten over 147,000 requests for WorldNet services and software since announcing the offering February 27, with over 210,000 separate inquiries. The service will offer five hours of free access each month for a year, and a $19.95 flat rate for unlimited service each month. Evslin says over half the calls were from people interested in the flat-rate plan, and that while additional customer service representatives are being assigned to handle the volume, it may take a few weeks for some people to get their software.

< <P><A NAME="story2">Key Escrow Fight Launched on Capitol Hill</A>
< <P> Introduction of the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996 (S.1587) ( <A HREF="http://www.epic.org/crypto/legislation/s1587.html">http://www.epic.org/crypto/legislation/s1587.html</A> ) should bring the issue of encryption-key escrow squarely before Congress, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( <A HREF="http://www.epic.org/">ttp://www.epic.org/</A> ).
< <P> The group's legal counsel, David Sobel, says while the bill is an advance over current privacy law, it doesn't satisfy his group because it still allows government access to the cryptographic keys used by consumers to encode credit cards and messages on the Internet. The bill would, however, eliminate export controls on standard encryption techniques like PGP and SET&#173;now coming into widespread use on the Web. EPIC wants the provisions on key escrow and export controls debated, and voted on, separately.
< <P> The government has long insisted that law enforcement and national security agencies must be able to decode Internet transmissions in some cases, or else spies and crooks will have a free reign. Sobel says that's not practical. "If you asked a foreign user whether they'll buy something the U.S. government holds a key to, it's obvious what the answer is," he says. The Clinton administration's decision to require use of a Clipper chip, with decryption keys held by the government, in all computer systems sold to the government "was clearly intended to influence the market at large, and it hasn't done that," Sobel adds.
< <P> With a presidential election coming up this year, it's noteworthy that when asked about encryption policy and key escrow, Republican front-runner Bob Dole indicated at a meeting with CEOs in Silicon Valley that his thoughts were in line with the industry's, Sobel says.

> <P><A NAME="story2">Netscape Signs Alliance With America Online</A>
> <P> As AOL readies for its WorldNet debut, it's also putting a more familiar face&#173;Netscape Navigator&#173;on the "Internet Connection," its barely one-year-old gateway to the net.
> <P> AOL has entered a marketing and technology alliance with Netscape ( <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">http://www.netscape.com</A> ). It was the second such deal for Netscape in as many business days, following a similar agreement with CompuServe ( <A HREF="http://www.compuserve.com">http://www.compuserve.com</A> ). America Online said it will license the Netscape Navigator browser for use both on its commercial online service and its GNN ( <A HREF="http://gnn.com">http://gnn.com</A> ) Internet-only service. America Online has over 5 million customers, and CompuServe 4 million more.
> <P> The deal is further confirmation of Netscape's evolution as the primary interface for the World Wide Web. CompuServe had bought Spry Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.spry.com">http://www.spry.com</A> ) of Seattle, which made the Internet in a Box package, including a Spyglass-licensed ( <A HREF="http://www.spyglass.com">http://www.spyglass.com</A> ) browser called Spry Mosaic. Around the same time, America Online bought a browser-maker, and eventually offered its members a proprietary browser as part of its basic "Internet Connection." Now, apparently, both those investments are being scrapped in favor of Netscape.
> <P> Still, it would be a mistake to write off Microsoft in the Web market, said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Inc., a San Jose, Calif., market research firm. "Anybody who thinks Bill Gates was asleep at the switch on this is absolutely wrong," he said. "Ultimately what Microsoft is going to say is, 'Hey, as far as we're concerned, the Internet interface is just part of the operating system.'"

< <P><A NAME="story3">Apple Signs on to Moving Worlds</A><BR>
< Apple ( <A HREF="http:/www.apple.com/">http:/www.apple.com/</A> ) has joined forces with Silicon Graphics ( <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com">http://www.sgi.com</A> ), Netscape ( <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">http://www.netscape.com/ ), and more than 50 other companies in support of the Moving Worlds VRML proposal for the Internet.
< <P> The alignment calls for use of Apple's QuickDraw 3-D metafile format ( <A HREF="http://www.info.apple.com/qd3d">http://www.info.apple.com/qd3d</A> ), which will be used as an object-oriented, binary "wrapper" in Moving Worlds. John McCrea, marketing manager for Internet and Web products at SGI, says the agreement puts enormous pressure on Microsoft, which proposed a different system called Active VRML.
< <P> Active VRML is a "FUD bomb" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), more of a "White Paper" than a working reality, according to McCrea. "We're able to offer an evolutionary step that leverages what others have been doing and embraces things that many people are doing," he says. McCrea calls VRML one of the "three open architectures" on the Web, alongside Sun's Java ( <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</A> ) and HTML itself.
< <P> While both the SGI-Netscape and Microsoft proposals are going before standards bodies, McCrea says the winner will likely be determined in the market. "We're talking weeks" before products are available on the Internet using Moving Worlds, he says. "You'll see a flurry of activity in the browser space, in the add-on capability space," McCrea adds.
< <P> A key event in the evolution of Moving Worlds will come when Netscape supports it directly in its Navigator browser, and the company is working to do just that, McCrea says. SGI, itself, is also working on an implementation of VRML in its Cosmo Player browser. "Certainly all this will happen in the first half of this calendar year," McCrea says.

> Graphic Imaging Inc. launched a new 3-D world called Old Town Crossroads ( <A HREF="http://www.gic.net/xroad.html">http://www.gic.net/xroad.html</A> ).
> <P> GIC president David Goldstein said that the business model for the new site is somewhat unformed, although he hopes to add some small ads to the site as traffic builds. "We don't want to charge users," he said. Graphic artist Tom Epps is Goldstein's partner in the venture.
> <P> The site is based on Macintosh software such as Infinity 3-D and basic HTML coding, not the Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) used by companies like Worlds Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.worlds.net">http://www.worlds.net</A> ). "VRML is something we'll get into in a few months.

We may have VRML for advanced users, but we want to have a good starting point for beginners."
> <P> Goldstein said he's designed his site as a consumer's first stop on the Web, with links to movie and TV sites, newspaper sites, and political sites, all easy to reach. Users can also register as citizens of Old Town, which might enable them to feel more connected or "at home" in cyberspace.

< The World Wide Web Consortium ( <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</A> ) says Microsoft, Netscape, and other major Web players have agreed to develop a common way of integrating style sheets into Web documents.
< <P> HTML was originally developed as a simple system of tags that users could control on their own. A common set of style sheets, defining what tags mean, will make it easier to print Web documents. The new style sheets will be based on Hakon Lie's Cascading Style Sheets initiative under way at the National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control in Sophia Antipolis, France.
< <P> "[Style sheets] can produce great-looking screens more easily than HTML itself," says W3C staff member Hakon Lie. "Large capital letters in HTML require use of multiple font tags," he says. "Style sheets just apply this naturally."
< <P> Other companies supporting the initiative include CompuServe, Adobe Systems Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">http://www.adobe.com/</A> ), Hewlett-Packard Co. ( <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">http://www.hp.com/</A> ), IBM ( <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">http://www.ibm.com/</A> ), O'Reilly &amp; Associates Inc.

"They call our service," enter a security code like that used for withdrawing money from an ATM machine, "and then they select options off the keypad to update specific links, say, with an audio message."

"You could call our system, select a numbered list, leave the message, and the audio goes out as an e-mail attachment," Rigby explains. Recipients can use whatever audio decoding program they prefer, although Connect Inc. is mainly using RealAudio ( <A HREF="http://www.realaudio.com">http://www.realaudio.com</A> ), "because it's most heavily used," Rigby says.

< <P><A NAME="story5">Internet Access not Equal Among Providers</A>
< <P> While not directly endorsing a proposal before the FCC to halt the sale of hardware and software for making voice calls on the Internet, a spokesman for one of the nation's largest long-distance companies tells NetDaily that equalizing the tax and access-charge treatments of Internet service providers and long-distance providers is an issue that must be addressed.
< <P> "Many states and localities charge taxes [to telephone companies] on long-distance calls placed in their jurisdictions, while local phone companies charge long distance companies heavy access fees for access to their local networks. Internet users don't pay these charges," says Gil Broyles, spokesman for Worldcom, the fourth-largest long-distance carrier. "That's an issue the FCC has to come to terms with. We think it's appropriate to raise."
< <P> The issue is made complex because all long-distance companies, including Worldcom, provide Internet access in one way or another. AT&amp;T ( <A HREF="http://www.att.com">http://www.att.com</A> ) and MCI ( <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">http://www.mci.com/</A> ) have both announced dial-up Internet access.

Although those companies do pay access fees to Worldcom as part of the charge for their lines, those charges are then passed on to users.
< <P> Broyles says the industry is not interested in going to war with the Internet. "The question is what constitutes a level playing field," he says.

> <P><A NAME="story1">AOL Demos Updated Software</A>
> <P> America Online is tooling up for a Web-friendly future, but its feet are still planted firmly in its proprietary world. On Wednesday, the Vienna, Va.-based commercial online service demonstrated updated versions of its Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Macintosh software at a day-long meeting with industry analysts and press representatives at its headquarters.
> <P> The new software is based on open Internet protocols and uses standard HTML protocols, in addition to supporting most Netscape extensions, says AOL vice president of product marketing David Gang. It will more tightly mix AOL content with Web content, he says. For example, you will be able to create URL links in e-mail. The e-mail feature will work when sending mail to other AOL users, as well as Microsoft Network and Netscape mail users.
> <P> However, AOL chairman and president Steve Case says he believes faster access speeds via ISDN and cable modems&#173;the stuff that ideal Web connections are made of&#173;are about three years away, which means AOL still will concentrate on making its service usable for customers at modem speeds of 9600 and 14.4-Kbps. "There is a reality gap between the mass consumer audience and the Web," Case says. "The truth is that using a 14.4 modem to access the Web is frustratingly slow. There just isn't enough evidence that the Web is ready for prime time."
> <P> In answer to press reports that the company is in talks with AT&amp;T about providing some AOL content on AT&amp;T's new WorldNet residential dial-up Internet access service, Case would confirm only that his company is "talking to everybody." AOL also is talking to Apple about acquiring its 147,000 eWorld online service customers when Apple closes the service at the end of March. AOL would not discuss details of any pending deals, other than to say talks were in progress with several companies.
> <P> AOL also says it will be improving its publishing tools for content partners, simplifying the software that allows them to drag and drop text and graphics into their home pages. AOL appears to be holding firm behind its belief that most consumers venturing online need guidance and help with where to go. Companies like AOL, Case says, are more helpful to consumers than companies that provide pure Internet access, making users fend for themselves on the net.
> <P> AOL will preview its Windows 3.1 upgrade April 15 and ship disks in July, according to AOL vice president of product marketing David Gang. The Windows 95 and Macintosh 3.0 upgrades will be available in August, though Mac users can use an interim upgrade, version 2.7, in May until the 3.0 version is ready for release in August.

> <P><A NAME="story2">Key Escrow Fight Launched on Capitol Hill</A>
> <P> Introduction of the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996 (S.1587) ( <A HREF="http://www.epic.org/crypto/legislation/s1587.html">http://www.epic.org/crypto/legislation/s1587.html</A> ) should bring the issue of encryption-key escrow squarely before Congress, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( <A HREF="http://www.epic.org/">ttp://www.epic.org/</A> ).
> <P> The group's legal counsel, David Sobel, says while the bill is an advance over current privacy law, it doesn't satisfy his group because it still allows government access to the cryptographic keys used by consumers to encode credit cards and messages on the Internet. The bill would, however, eliminate export controls on standard encryption techniques like PGP and SET&#173;now coming into widespread use on the Web. EPIC wants the provisions on key escrow and export controls debated, and voted on, separately.
> <P> The government has long insisted that law enforcement and national security agencies must be able to decode Internet transmissions in some cases, or else spies and crooks will have a free reign. Sobel says that's not practical. "If you asked a foreign user whether they'll buy something the U.S. government holds a key to, it's obvious what the answer is," he says. The Clinton administration's decision to require use of a Clipper chip, with decryption keys held by the government, in all computer systems sold to the government "was clearly intended to influence the market at large, and it hasn't done that," Sobel adds.
> <P> With a presidential election coming up this year, it's noteworthy that when asked about encryption policy and key escrow, Republican front-runner Bob Dole indicated at a meeting with CEOs in Silicon Valley that his thoughts were in line with the industry's, Sobel says.

> <P><A NAME="story3">Apple Signs on to Moving Worlds</A><BR>
> Apple ( <A HREF="http:/www.apple.com/">http:/www.apple.com/</A> ) has joined forces with Silicon Graphics ( <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com">http://www.sgi.com</A> ), Netscape ( <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">http://www.netscape.com/ ), and more than 50 other companies in support of the Moving Worlds VRML proposal for the Internet.
> <P> The alignment calls for use of Apple's QuickDraw 3-D metafile format ( <A HREF="http://www.info.apple.com/qd3d">http://www.info.apple.com/qd3d</A> ), which will be used as an object-oriented, binary "wrapper" in Moving Worlds. John McCrea, marketing manager for Internet and Web products at SGI, says the agreement puts enormous pressure on Microsoft, which proposed a different system called Active VRML.
> <P> Active VRML is a "FUD bomb" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt), more of a "White Paper" than a working reality, according to McCrea. "We're able to offer an evolutionary step that leverages what others have been doing and embraces things that many people are doing," he says. McCrea calls VRML one of the "three open architectures" on the Web, alongside Sun's Java ( <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</A> ) and HTML itself.
> <P> While both the SGI-Netscape and Microsoft proposals are going before standards bodies, McCrea says the winner will likely be determined in the market. "We're talking weeks" before products are available on the Internet using Moving Worlds, he says. "You'll see a flurry of activity in the browser space, in the add-on capability space," McCrea adds.
> <P> A key event in the evolution of Moving Worlds will come when Netscape supports it directly in its Navigator browser, and the company is working to do just that, McCrea says. SGI, itself, is also working on an implementation of VRML in its Cosmo Player browser. "Certainly all this will happen in the first half of this calendar year," McCrea says.

> <P><A NAME="story4">Companies Support Standardized Web Style Sheets</A><BR>
> The World Wide Web Consortium ( <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</A> ) says Microsoft, Netscape, and other major Web players have agreed to develop a common way of integrating style sheets into Web documents.
> <P> HTML was originally developed as a simple system of tags that users could control on their own. A common set of style sheets, defining what tags mean, will make it easier to print Web documents. The new style sheets will be based on Hakon Lie's Cascading Style Sheets initiative under way at the National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control in Sophia Antipolis, France.
> <P> "[Style sheets] can produce great-looking screens more easily than HTML itself," says W3C staff member Hakon Lie. "Large capital letters in HTML require use of multiple font tags," he says. "Style sheets just apply this naturally."
> <P> Other companies supporting the initiative include CompuServe, Adobe Systems Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">http://www.adobe.com/</A> ), Hewlett-Packard Co. ( <A HREF="http://www.hp.com/">http://www.hp.com/</A> ), IBM ( <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/">http://www.ibm.com/</A> ), O'Reilly &amp; Associates Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.ora.com/">http://www.ora.com/</A> ), and Spyglass Inc. ( <A HREF="http://www.spyglass.com/">http://www.spyglass.com/</A> ).
> <P> A working draft of the CSS proposal is available at <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/WD-css1">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TR/WD-css1</A> .

> <P><A NAME="story5">Internet Access not Equal Among Providers</A>
> <P> While not directly endorsing a proposal before the FCC to halt the sale of hardware and software for making voice calls on the Internet, a spokesman for one of the nation's largest long-distance companies tells NetDaily that equalizing the tax and access-charge treatments of Internet service providers and long-distance providers is an issue that must be addressed.
> <P> "Many states and localities charge taxes [to telephone companies] on long-distance calls placed in their jurisdictions, while local phone companies charge long distance companies heavy access fees for access to their local networks. Internet users don't pay these charges," says Gil Broyles, spokesman for Worldcom, the fourth-largest long-distance carrier. "That's an issue the FCC has to come to terms with. We think it's appropriate to raise."
> <P> The issue is made complex because all long-distance companies, including Worldcom, provide Internet access in one way or another. AT&amp;T ( <A HREF="http://www.att.com">http://www.att.com</A> ) and MCI ( <A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">http://www.mci.com/</A> ) have both announced dial-up Internet access. Sprint has a packet network, but, like Worldcom, also leases lines to Internet service providers like PSINet ( <A HREF="http://www.psi.net/">http://www.psi.net/</A> ), Uunet ( <A HREF="http://www.uu.net/">http://www.uu.net/</A> ), and Netcom ( <A HREF="http://www.netcom.com/">http://www.netcom.com/</A> ). Although those companies do pay access fees to Worldcom as part of the charge for their lines, those charges are then passed on to users.
> <P> Broyles says the industry is not interested in going to war with the Internet. "The question is what constitutes a level playing field," he says.

> <P><A NAME="story6">Alta Vista Offers Applet Searches</A><BR>
> The Alta Vista ( <A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/">http://altavista.digital.com/</A> ) search engine now can search the Web for applets, according to Digital Equipment Corp.
> <P> Spokesman Patrick Ward says the "super spider" program behind Alta Vista already has found 24,000 applets in its index of more than 21 million Web features. "To our knowledge it's the first search engine to search for the actual code that marks the presence of an applet," he says. "Alta Vista looks for the HTML wording that shows an applet is included in a page. What I've found is there are a lot of pages that include applets with no reference to their presence."
> <P> Applets are Java ( <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</A> ) programs that only work on computers with browsers that support Java. By searching applets, Ward says, users can learn a lot about how they're written and what they can do. These lessons can then be applied on their own Web pages.

> SPORTS ILLUSTRATED ( <A HREF="http://www.pathfinder.com/si">http://www.pathfinder.com/si</A> ) and the Augusta Chronicle say they'll launch a special site covering the 1996 Master's Golf tournament ( <A HREF="http://masters96.com">http://masters96.com</A> ) during the week of the event, April 7 to 14. The site will include audio and video clips of each day's play and the newspaper's print coverage of the event.
> <P> INTERNET EXPLORER 2.0 software under Windows 95 now is available in 22 languages. The software can be downloaded for free from Microsoft's Web site ( <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A> ).
> <P> KAPLAN INTERACTIVE has put a version of the best-seller Life's Little Instruction Book on its Web site ( <A HREF="http://www.kaplan.com/cellar/life">http://www.kaplan.com/cellar/life</A> ). Visitors can send electronic postcards with any of the books 511 "life tips" directly from the site.
> <P> SPIV ( <A HREF="http://www.spiv.com/">http://www.spiv.com/</A> ), a Web site for 20-somethings, from Turner Broadcasting System Inc., has introduced a series of-public service announcements. The PSAs, called Catalyst (http://www.spiv.com/catalyst), offer information on issues from racism to AIDS, with links to related organizations.
