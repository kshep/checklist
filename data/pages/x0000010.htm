But the partner turns out to be MFS, as in MFS Communications Co., Inc., an Omaha, Neb., company that provides business and government customers with local and long-distance voice  and data communications services. <P>  Uunet , the Fairfax-Va.-based Internet services company that built the  Microsoft Network, and MFS announced yesterday that they would join forces in  a merger that makes the Internet company that specializes in corporate  connections a wholly owned division of MFS. <P>  Wall Street loved the plan, and Uunet's stock was several points higher at  the close of business yesterday than at the morning opening.  The merger will  convert Uunet stock into MFS stock, with the value on the transactions placed at about $2  billion. <P>  Wall Street's giddiness even spilled over onto other Internet service  providers who weren't involved in the deal. For instance, PSINet benefited  from the news, as its stock rousted itself from the doldrums where they'd  been stuck for the past several weeks. <P>  "Consolidation" has been the watchword in the Internet access business  lately. As more and more telecommunications companies, such as AT&amp;T, MCI, and  Bell Atlantic edge into that market, the Uunet-MFS announcement was seen as a  sign of mergers to come. <P>  The synergy between the two companies seems ideal, according to financial and  industry analysts. Both concentrate on providing access&#173;Internet and  telecommunications&#173;to businesses. <P>  "We wanted to join up with a telephone company that didn't act like a telephone company," says Alan Taffel, Uunet vice president of marketing. "MFS  is entrepreneurial and quick to move, which is necessary in this market." <P>  The merger will create a company that can offer one-stop shopping for  Internet, voice, data, and video services to business customers over an  advanced, international, fiber-optic network. According to officials at the  two companies, their combined annual revenue will be about $12.24 billion. <P>  Competitive Access Providers (CAPs) like MFS provide telecommunications  services to businesses, often to the dismay of Bell telephone companies that  are more heavily regulated. Bell companies have often complained that  providers like MFS can skim off their most profitable business customers,  leaving them to provide mandated service to less-profitable residential  markets, no matter what their location. <P>  MFS has laid 213,000 miles of fiber-optic cable networks in metropolitan areas around the United States and in Western Europe.  Since more than 40  percent of Uunet's network expenses go to buying local communications  services, the company now will be able to drive down costs by buying local  access wholesale from the MFS telecommunications group. <P>  Uunet will give MFS the ability to bring Internet access to its customers. Uunet has a reputation for providing reliable Internet services to its own users, as well as to the million-plus MSN customers that use the same network.  Microsoft, which owns 13 percent of Uunet, has given the access provider a $25-million interest-free loan to further build out its Internet network last year, which now has 218 points of presence. <P>  MFS also has 1,200 sales representatives in place to sell the combined services, Taffel says, many more than Uunet. <P>  "The merger raises the bar for other ISPs in terms of competing on cost-structure now that Uunet is affiliated with a facilities-based communications company," Taffel says. <P>  The partnership was not unexpected, according to Dan Cunningham, <A HREF="http://www.psi.net">PSINet's</A> vice president for finance.  "It gives MFS the ability  to bundle an Internet product with telephone service.  It will be cutting new ground, because so far, this is an untested market product," he says. <P>  The move made sense to Tom Evslin, AT&amp;T WorldNet vice president, as well.  "The industry is desegregating online content from access, so now it can  reaggregate along lines that make more sense.  Internet access is more closely aligned with network telephony than with online content," he says.<P>  This kind of thinking seems to be the wave of the future, as illustrated by  <A HREF="http://www.mci.com">MCI</A>, which announced Monday that it will now offer packages of long-distance and cellular services along with Internet access.  Microsoft's Bill Gates blessed the merger, too:  "We are highly  supportive of this merger with MFS, since the combination offers the potential for high bandwidth availability at lower costs for end users."<P>  <ADDRESS>&#173;<A HREF="mailto:kgerwig @cmp.com"> Kate Gerwig </A></ADDRESS><P>  <A HREF="#anchor"><FONT SIZE="-1">Return to News Listings</FONT></A> <HR><P>   <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR=" DD0000"><A NAME="story2"> WEB BROWSERS</A></FONT><P>  <FONT SIZE="5"> Netscape Begins Public Beta of Version 3.0</FONT><P>  <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</A> officially launched the public beta test  of  Navigator 3.0, the newest version of its popular Web browser.<P>  The software, which has been available on the company's Web site for some  time, fully integrates video, audio 3-D, and Internet telephony capability  with its other features. The new software can be customized for enterprise.  Netscape also reports improvements in such 2.0 features as JavaScript,  security, and caching. Its built-in multimedia and telephony support should  prove controversial with makers of competing products.<P>  (By the way, If you do choose to download the program, keep in mind it's now  over 3.5 Mbytes in size.)<P>  <ADDRESS>&#173;<A HREF="mailto:dblanken@cmp.com"> Dana Blankenhorn</A></ADDRESS><P>  <A HREF="#anchor"><FONT SIZE="-1">Return to News Listings</FONT></A> <HR><P>   <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR=" DD0000"><A NAME="story3"> SEARCH TOOLS</A></FONT><P>  <FONT SIZE="5"> CyberHound Directory and Search Service Bows<FONT><P>  The hotly competitive Web directory and search engine arena got even more  crowded Tuesday as <A HREF="http://www.gale.com/gale.html">Gale Research</A>, a company  that has been producing print directories for more than 40 years, introduced  <A HREF="http://www.cyberhound.com">CyberHound</A> at the Internet World trade show in  San Jose.<P>  But while the world now has yet another service that seeks and reviews Web  sites, people will have to wait a bit longer to find out if they're going  to have to pay for CyberHound's pedigreed lineage.<P>  Gale Research executives announcing the service would say only that the site  will be free for users on a trial basis for the next three months. Gale  Marketing Manager Margaret Tennant says Gale "has not yet determined specific  pricing," but adds CyberHound will accept advertising.<P>  "We provide a solution to Internet frustration,› says Joanna Zakalik, senior  new product development editor.  "The frustration is the result of the  enormous amount of information that is available on the Internet and with the  other search engines that provide thousands of hits," she says.  Spiders  [software that gathers information for many search engines] provide lots of  hits but not good quality. CyberHound relies on human rather than artificial  intelligence to sort and index sites,› she says.<P>  Calling it both a "simple and expert search engine," Koek says CyberHound,  can return more accurate hits than software-based search engines because  humans  determine the site's search delimiters. Reviewed sites can receive one to  four stars and are rated based on content, design, technical merit and  entertainment value.<P>  CyberHound's more complex "expert" option offers users a much broader choice  of searching criteria than most search engines, with options that include  information about how frequently sites are updated, whether they accept  advertising, or whether fees are charged for access. In addition to Web sites  and Usenet newsgroups, CyberHound can search listservs, gopher, FTP or telnet  sites.<P>  Gale's database, however, includes only information compiled and reviewed by  its staff of 10 editors and approximately 100 freelancers in the past four  months.  While almost 10,000 sites are currently available, CyberHound  Project Manager Karen Koek says Gale hopes to have 35,000 site reviews online  by the end of the year.<P>  The Detroit company, which publishes reference works such as the Encyclopedia  of Associations, also compiles databases and offers CD-RO M-based products.<P>  <ADDRESS>&#173;<A HREF="mailto:jbernste@cmp.com"> Judith H.

At the Internet World trade show in San Jose Tuesday, the company  announced <A HREF="http://www.yahoocomputing.com">Yahoo Computing</A>, a partnership with  Ziff-Davis Publishing Co.<P>  The site will go live at noon today.<P>  Yahoo Computing was created by culling 35,000 sites from Yahoo's original  Computing and Internet categories and combining it with other features, such  as site reviews, news updates and original editorial material. Officials from  Yahoo and Ziff say they plan eventually to create a "community" on the site by  offering speakers, discussion groups and chat options.<P>  "We built it as an interactive travel guide and travel service to computing  sites on the Web," says Ed Passarella, editorial director for Yahoo  Computing. To date, he says, the site has accumulated more than 500 reviews,  which are rated with up to four stars, and plans to present roundups of  specific topic-oriented sites.<P>  <ADDRESS>&#173;<A HREF="mailto:jbernste@cmp.com">Judith H.

At $79, it's the same price as Netscape  Navigator, says Macromedia president Bud Colligan. Scalable upgrades range  all the way up to Backstage Enterprise Studio, a version checking in at  $2,999. The top-level product allows direct links to client-services  databases such as those from Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL,  without programming.<P>  Yesterday at Internet World,  product manager Stephen Shannon demonstrated  Backstage. It features a Microsoft Word-like  interface, and can toggle  between views of a page as it will appear on the Web and its source code.<P>  Perhaps the most intriguing parts of the $99 Backstage Designer Plus are a  series of  PowerApplets, customizable Macromedia Director and Java  applications that add multimedia to Web pages without programming. That  product, the first upgrade level from the freely downloaded program, also  includes an image editor called Macromedia xRes, and a library of clip art.<P>  "Our strategy is author once, offer anywhere," says Colligan. The same tools  and files being used to build Internet and intranet pages can also be used on  CD-ROMs and even in movie production. "Compression, security and streaming  should all be integrated" with authoring tools, he says, and all those files  should be available on all media.<P>   "We're going to 'shock' everything," he says, referring to Macromedia's  Shockwave plug-ins. He adds that the company will continue its work with  Microsoft to "harmonize" its multimedia scripting languages.<P>  <ADDRESS>&#173;<A HREF="mailto:dblanken@cmp.com">Dana Blankenhorn </A></ADDRESS><P>   <FONT SIZE="4" COLOR=" DD0000"><A NAME="story6"> WEB TOOLS Cont'd.</A></FONT><P>  <FONT SIZE="5"> Animation Software Makes Its Moves<FONT><P>  Among the products being previewed to the crowds at Internet World this week  is FutureWave's CelAnimator, which hits the streets with a $250 price tag in  June. However, Web developers can download a free beta now at  <A HREF="http://www.futurewave.com">http://www.futurewave.com</A>.<P>  This cross-platform product can create drawings and animations for Web pages.  CelAnimator allows you to create static or animated cartoons, logos, or  interactive buttons. Animation sequences created with CelAnimator are saved  in FutureSplash format and are streamed as a user accesses them. "This  eliminates wait time because animations play as they are downloaded" says  Jonathan Gay, vice president of development for FutureWave, of San Diego.<P>  CelAnimator's key features like a natural drawing tools and animation  controls.
