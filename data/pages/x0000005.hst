< <P> Forbes to quit
< <P> Republican presidential aspirant Steve Forbes is dropping out of the race after being trounced by front-runner Bob Dole in Tuesday's seven primaries.
< <P> CNN has learned that Forbes will make a formal announcement Thursday.
< <P> The publishing heir, who spent millions of his own money on his campaign, met with his aides Wednesday in Washington and concluded that it was time to bow out.
< <P> Forbes had vowed as recently as this morning to stay in the race through next Tuesday's Midwestern primaries. | <A HREF="http://allpolitics.com/news/9603/13/forbes.quits/">-Full Story-</A>
