< <P></A> As a co-founder of NetDay, KQED's Michael Kaufman has been instrumental in getting the NetDay web site running, and in publicizing the NetDay event on regional media. <A HREF=http://www.kqed.org/>KQED radio</A> in San Francisco is providing webmaster services for the NetDay '96 site. <A HREF=http://www.well.com/>The Well</A> is providing Internet connectivity.
< <P><A name=connectivity><P> What is Internet Connectivity?
< <P></A> To go "online" a school needs not only computers installed in the classroom or lab, but must also have wiring in the building that leads to the interface to the phone company or other Internet Service Provider. While many schools can get access to computers, and Internet Access providers have offered cheap or free internet connection, schools still don't have the wiring to connect the two.
< <P> Schools and School Districts are coming online every day with technical and resource information to support NetDay '96. A few of interest are: | <A HREF=http://www.ousd.k12.ca.us/>Oakland Unified School District</A> | <A HREF=http://www.slocs.k12.ca.us/calpage1.htm>California school districts (42)</A> on the Web | <A HREF=http://www.mste.uiuc.edu/k12/k12.html>National listing of K-12 School Home pages</A> | <A HREF=http://www.netday96.com/Information/sites.html>Educational Resource Web sites</A> courtesy NetDay '96 | <BR>

< <P> Category 5 Wire?? ...huh?
< <P> Category 5 Wire is the standard for network installation for today's corporate networks. It is easy work with, and can be cut to length and installed in very tight spaces. Easily installed modular jacks allow you to just plug into computer or network interface.
< <P> Inexpensive at up to $.10 per foot, this cable is capable of carrying the higher speed traffic required for an acceptable level of performance on the Internet. This is the wiring that comes as a part of the <A HREF=http://www.netday96.com/kits/kitlist.html>NetDay Wiring Kit</A>
< <P> The <A HREF=http://www.netday96.com/btw/>Cable Installation Guide</A> is a complete step-by-step procedure for installing the Category 5 wiring.
