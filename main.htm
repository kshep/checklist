<P>
Your CheckList is a personalized list of World Wide Web pages that
the CheckList server automatically follows for you. The CheckList server
watches the pages on your list and keeps track of changes to those pages.
All the changes since you last visited those sites are summarized for
you on single page every time your visit your CheckList.
<P>
You can access your CheckList from any computer connected to the Web,
whether you're at home, work, school, or on the road, so don't have
to maintain seperate hotlists at work and at home. In fact, with a
CheckList you don't even need your own computer to keep track of
interesting sites!
<P>
If you're using Netscape 2.0, you can upload your hotlist or any other
document containing links to the CheckList server and selectively add the
links in the document to your CheckList.
